Launchpad using keyboard to play sounds.

Developed in C++ using Qt-5.1 and FModEx-4.44

Launchpad realised to use sounds during improvisational theatre cabaret.

The folder "fmod_lib" contains the dll and the headers for FMODEx library

For now it is compiled as 64bits software. I will install Qt 5.1 32bits to be able to compile to another platform
