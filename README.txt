Launchpad using keyboard to play sounds.

Developed in C using SDL and FModEx-4.44

Launchpad realised to use sounds during improvisational theatre cabaret.

The folder "fmod_lib" contains the dll and the headers for FMODEx library

For now it is compiled as 32bits software. There is a makefile in the directory "src".

The sounds charged are associated with the key which is is the beginning of the name of the file.
For exemple : The program will associate "F1_ps1.mp3" to the F1 key and "SPACE_.mp3" to the space key.
The formate for a sound is so "keyName_*".

The ESC is to escape the program, the UP and DOWN keys to respectively up or down the volume and the LEFT and RIGHT keys to stop the sound currently played.
